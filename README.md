# 🐍 Snake

## 🧩 Quest Summary
A classic Snake game built to explore **grid based movement**, **state growth**, and **collision based failure conditions**.

This project emphasizes **deterministic movement** and **state expansion logic**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Implement grid locked movement
- Grow player state based on events
- Detect self collision and boundary failure

---

## 🔓 Skills Unlocked
- Discrete movement systems
- Event driven state growth
- Collision based game over logic

---

## 🛠 Core Systems
- Fixed timestep movement
- Grid based position tracking
- Score and restart handling

---

## 🚀 How to Play
1. Clone the repository  
2. Run the game file  
3. Control the snake using keyboard input  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Explored
Grid systems, deterministic movement, game state management

---

## 🎖 Achievement
Implemented a growing player system with consistent logic and clean state handling
